# Responsive Personal Portfolio Page Template

![Preview](images/preview.jpeg)

## Getting started

The existing page's style is sufficient with Tailwind CSS. If you want to change the style, you can run the following command in the console:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss -i ./style.css -o ./tailwind.css --minify
```

If you don't need anything extra, you don't need to do anything else.
